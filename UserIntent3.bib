	Abstract = {Physicians have many questions when caring for patients, and frequently need to seek answers for their questions. Information retrieval systems (e.g., PubMed) typically return a list of documents in response to a user's query. Frequently the number of returned documents is large and makes physicians' information seeking "practical only 'after hours' and not in the clinical settings". Question answering techniques are based on automatically analyzing thousands of electronic documents to generate short-text answers in response to clinical questions that are posed by physicians. The authors address physicians' information needs and described the design, implementation, and evaluation of the medical question answering system (MedQA). Although our long term goal is to enable MedQA to answer all types of medical questions, currently, we implemented MedQA to integrate information retrieval, extraction, and summarization techniques to automatically generate paragraph-level text for definition},

To achieve this, they rely on the number of webpages that are found through a Google search containing a given word and they associate the page count to the probability that the word appears on a webpage. Thus, conditional probabilities allow them to correlate one word with another word's meaning. Furthermore, they have developed a similarity distance function that gauges how closely related a pair of words is. We present a specific counterexample to the triangle inequality for this similarity distance function.},

	Abstract = {Ontology alignment is the key point to reach interoperability over ontologies. In semantic web environment, ontologies are usually distributed and heterogeneous and thus it is necessary to find the alignment between them before processing across them. Many efforts have been conducted to automate the alignment by discovering the correspondence between entities of ontologies. However, some problems are still obvious, and the most crucial one is that it is almost impossible to extract semantic meaning of a lexical label that denotes the entity by traditional methods. In this paper, ontology alignment is formalized as a problem of information distance metric. In this way, discovery of optimal alignment is cast as finding out the correspondences with minimal information distance. We demonstrate a novel measure named link weight that uses semantic characteristics of two entities and Google page count to calculate an information distance similarity between them. The experimental results show},

Is this progress significant enough to pursue further research? If so, what are the particularly promising directions? To answer these questions, we review the state of the art of ontology matching and analyze the results of recent ontology matching evaluations. These results show a measurable improvement in the field, the speed of which is albeit slowing down. We conjecture that significant improvements can be obtained only by addressing important challenges for ontology matching. We present such challenges with insights on how to approach them, thereby aiming to direct research into the most promising tracks and to facilitate the progress of the field.},

For computers the equivalent of `society' is `database,' and the equivalent of `use' is `way to search the database.' We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts we use the world-wide-web as database, and Google as search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the world-wide-web using Google page counts. The world-wide-web is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality.

It is based on Kolmogorov complexity and thus uncomputable, but there are ways to utilize it. First, compression algorithms can be used to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity if the objects have a string representation. Second, for names and abstract concepts, page count statistics from the World Wide Web can be used. These practical realizations of the normalized information distance can then be applied to machine learning tasks, expecially clustering, to perform feature-free and parameter-free data mining. This chapter discusses the theoretical foundations of the normalized information distance and both practical realizations. It presents numerous examples of successful real-world applications based on these distance measures, ranging from bioinformatics to music clustering to machine translation.},

We propose a new 'normalized information distance,' based on the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity, and show that it is in this class and it minorizes every computable distance in the class (that is, it is universal in that it discovers all computable similarities). We demonstrate that it is a metric and call it the similarity metric. This theory forms the foundation for a new practical tool. To evidence generality and robustness, we give two distinctive applications in widely divergent areas using standard compression programs like gzip and GenCompress. First, we compare whole mitochondrial genomes and infer their evolutionary history. This results in a first completely automatic computed whale mitochondrial phylogeny tree.
