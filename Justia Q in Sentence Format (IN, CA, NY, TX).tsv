does an emergency room have to contact you back about test results if you left before you were able to receive them	1
i went to an emergency room complaining of severe liver pain	1
i had a blood test done and had been patiently waiting in the emergency room for well over  hours	1
however i was no longer able to wait and decided to leave and try back another day	1
if something abnormal showed up in the blood test does the emergency room have the obligation and responsibility to try and contact me back to inform me of the complications even if i left before the results were able to be shared	1
the reason i am wondering this is because people could possibly leave the emergency room before being seen and without finding out they may have life threatening health issues	1
since the complications could be life threatening shouldnt they try and contact you back to inform you and to get you seen with a doctor immediately	1

my old lawyer put the wrong date for when my husband entered the us illegally on all of our immigration forms	1
my husband had a deportation order out for him but we hired a lawyer and he was able to get him a work permit and stall it	1
while he did this we were also going through the process of trying to obtain legal residency for him	1
the problem is that to obtain the work permit the lawyer without consulting me put that my husband arrived in the us earlier than he actually did	1
so when they asked us for proof we had none and were denied our claim	1
this incorrect date is all over our immigration packet and were not sure if anything can be done to try to fix this and still obtain him his residency	1
would we have to redo the whole process and start all over	1
or would that not even work and is our case a lost cause	1

this should be illegal in california - does being an intern make any difference	1
i have spent one year working as an intern in california	1
the contract specified a rate per hour and gave pto	1
i did not use any of this owing to only taking days in lieu after working many hours overtime	1
at the end i was told i would not be paid my pto owing to a use it or lose it policy which is supposed to explicitly be illegal in california - pto is considered as days already worked but not yet paid	1
however i was told that the pto granted was not a policy but a component of the internship seemingly meaning that this law does not apply to this pto	1
this doesnt sound right at all	1

i was in a altercation with my girlfriend	1
things led to etting physical and to defend myself i shoved her against a parked car	1

i would like to know how i can settle this problem without having to take it to court and paying $	1

divorce form fl- petition community property	1
under the community property section i was told i could simply list the assets and debts as there are not very many	1
for bank accounts amd credit cards do i list all individual accounts and whos names are on them with the names of the banks and account numbers or simply write that there are joint and individual checking and savings accounts and credit cards	1
also my husband has a small business	1
do i list this as an asset	1
i have tried for two weeks to research this question and i have not found an answer in anything online	1
in a revocable living trust may i identify secondary bequests and beneficiaries in an attached schedule	1
we have a r	1
trust with all major assets listed in an attached schedule a and beneficiaries of thos assets identified in the body of the trust	1
we have a large quantity of personal items that do not require registration or documentation for identity and a number of benificiaries of those those items that i would like to list in a separate schedule b instead of in the body of the trust	1
would that be legal	1
reason for using the schedule b is that the bequests of personal items changes from time to time and making the changes would be much easier with the schedule than by changing the whole trust	1

is it legal for seller agent to change property description after we have gone into escrow	1
hi we just went into escrow to purchase a new home	1
however we have just been informed that an built in bbq area aka outdoor kitchen is going to taken from the home	1
when we looked at the original description of the home it said that    the beautiful backyard has a covered patio featuring a built-in bbq area bbq not included and ceiling fans	1
we assumed this meant the sellers would be taking the drop in bbq with them but not the whole built in bbq area outdoor kitchen	1
also now we have noticed that the sellers agent has changed the description of the house on all the websites so nothing about a built in bbq area is even mentioned	1
that is after we asked for clarification on this matter	1

but article  section  paragraph  states that its up to the government to organize arm and disciple the militia	1
can one not suggest that the authority granted therein has also evolved from regulating the militia to regulating private gun ownership	1

hello my question is for a criminal case in the state of california	2
penal code section	2
the penal code section	1
states that an attorney can not release  the address or telephone number of a victim or witness whose name is disclosed to the attorney pursuant to subdivision a of section	1
if the   alleged victim   and the defendant both lived at the same address and shared the same phone number	1
still bar the attorney from disclosing information to the defendant	1
what is happening here is that the defendant is requesting some of the reports so that he can go over them and make notes for the attorney	1
this would help with the legwork because the defendant is on very limited funds	1
it could also help catch the    alleged victim   in some lies	1
the attorney will not share reports because it had address and phone number	1
these are not    new   address or phone	1

we are having a baby in june and he will be moving in march	1

technically he will be renting from me without a lease agreement he will be paying half of everything from mortgage to property tax to utilities he still wont have rights is this correct	1

lets say  a family member takes you to court and says that the property is that persons also because it says so in their fathers trust	1
but the trust fails because their father did not transfer property into trust he resold it to you in your trust	1
you are sole owner of property	1

is it considered possession to have something which may have absorbed traces of weed smoke from others such as clothes	1
in other words i wanted to know if mere smoke from those who do weed which may have seeped into a car house cloths or on surfaces count as possession of an illegal substance even if one has never done it themselves	1

all the research i have done states that i should be able to receive an occupational license but i practically drive for a living outside sales and need to be fairly wide open on restrictions	1

i have a girl living in the house who is adamant on leaving despite no one wanting her here so i have to take it into my own hands now and try to get her deported or at the very least give her a warning that she is not staying in our house without consequences	1
her moving here i believe is one of the violations	1
she has not informed anyone of her change of address though she uses it in for her mail	1
another violation i think is the fact that she dropped out of high school two months before her senior year ended only because she got caught smoking weed and got in a fight with her mother so decided to run away for two days to our house but that stay ended up lasting five months	1
but she transferred to another school nearby and is attending again so not sure if that cancels out the violation	1

she is also working at a salon which is not an on campus job	1

a week ago our agent called us to inform us the builder now wanted a  earnest money deposit	1
thats not written in the contract	1
he gave us an amendment paper for the contract but the builders request is written not printed	1
it states   buyers to deposit an additional  of earnest money	1
if buyer fails to close earnest money will be returned to seller	1
that sounds awfully vague	1
in addition he demands we sign a release of earnest money form	1
the form seems like an authorization for the builder to obtain the earnest money	1
what happens if we decide to not sign the amendment paper	1
the whole earnest money request sounds fishy	1
